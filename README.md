**An attempt to detect sensitive information typed on a user's keyboard based on the sound emitted by the keys.**

----------------------------
## How to run the project

* If you are using **Colab**:
   1. Create a folder in Google Drive called `ML_PROJECT`. This should be the path of the directory `/content/drive/My Drive/ML_PROJECT` you have just created. Now, place the following inside the folder:
       - The file `information.csv`
       - The directory `sounds`
       - The notebook `Password_Detection_through_Sound.ipynb`
    
   2. Run the notebook, following the initial setup steps. Make sure to use GPU for faster training.

* If you are running **locally**:
   1. Clone the repository.
   2. Install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
   3. Open the notebook `Password_Detection_through_Sound.ipynb`.
   4. **Do not** run the first code cell to mount Google Drive.
   5. Adjust the paths according to your local folder organization.
